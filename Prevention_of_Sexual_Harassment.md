# Prevention of Sexual Harassment
**1. What kind of behavior is considered sexual harassment?**

Sexual harassment is when someone behaves in a way that’s sexual and makes another person feel uncomfortable, unsafe, embarrassed, or disrespected. This can include:

- Touching someone without their permission, like brushing against them or patting them

- Making inappropriate jokes or comments about someone’s body or appearance

- Showing sexual pictures or videos at work (even on your phone or screen)

- Making rude or suggestive remarks

- Sending unwanted messages or texts with sexual content

- Asking someone out repeatedly after they’ve said no

- Staring in a creepy or threatening way

Basically, if it’s sexual in nature and makes someone feel bad or unsafe, it can be harassment.

**2. What would you do if you face or see someone facing sexual harassment?**

If something like this happens to me or I see it happening to someone else, here’s what I would do:

- Write it down – I’d note when and where it happened, who was involved, and what exactly was said or done.

- Tell the right people – I’d report it to the Internal Committee (IC), HR, or whoever is responsible in my company.

- Support the person affected – If I saw it happen to someone else, I’d let them know they’re not alone and encourage them to report it.

- Stay professional – I’d avoid spreading rumors or taking sides. Just stick to the facts.

- Keep it private – I’d respect the privacy of everyone involved while the issue is being handled.

The main thing is to take it seriously, speak up, and follow the proper steps to make sure the workplace stays safe and respectful.
