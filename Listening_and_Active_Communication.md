# Listening and Active Communication

## 1. Active Listening


### Question 1: What are the steps/strategies to do Active Listening? 

1. **Give full attention to the speaker** – Avoid distractions like phone, thoughts, or surroundings. Make eye contact and stay present.
2. **Show that you're listening** – Use non-verbal cues like nodding, facial expressions, and short verbal affirmations like “I see” or “Right”.
3. **Avoid interrupting** – Let the speaker finish their thoughts before jumping in with your own ideas or opinions.
4. **Ask clarifying questions** – If something is unclear, ask questions to better understand the speaker's message.
5. **Paraphrase or summarize** – Repeat in your own words what the speaker said to confirm understanding.
6. **Empathize with the speaker** – Try to understand their emotions and point of view without judgment.

## 2. Reflective Listening

### Question 2: According to Fisher's model, what are the key points of Reflective Listening?

Reflective listening is more than just hearing someone. It's about fully understanding and responding thoughtfully. According to Fisher’s model, the key points are:

- **Repeat or paraphrase** what the speaker has said to confirm the message was received correctly.
- **Show empathy** by understanding the speaker’s feelings and reflecting those emotions back.
- **Use body language** like nodding, leaning forward, or mirroring to show engagement.
- **Clarify misunderstandings** by checking facts and asking questions.
- **Don’t judge** – allow the speaker to express themselves freely.
- **Give feedback** based on what the person actually said, not what you assume.

Reflective listening is especially useful in high-stakes or emotional situations, such as business meetings, conflict resolution, or technical discussions, where accurate understanding is crucial.
